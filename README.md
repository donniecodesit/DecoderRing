# Decoder Ring Application
This application allows users to input different types of text and encode or decode them into secret messages with 3 types of cyphers!
This was built using JavaScript programming, and Test Driven Development was done using Mocha and Chai. I worked on this during Week 4 of my Software Engineering Course at Thinkful.

## How to install
1. Either clone, fork, or download and unzip this repository to a new folder on your computer.
2. Open a terminal inside of the new folder and run `npm install`, which will install all of the required modules.
3. Afterwards, run `npm start` and go to `localhost:8080` in your browser. Enjoy! :)

### Notes
The "shift" number for Caesar refers to how many letters forwards or backwards you want to shift in the alphabet.

The "alphabet key" for Substitution refers to a new 26 character alphabet you input, which must have no duplicates.

Example: `zyxwvutrsqponmlkjihgfedcba`
