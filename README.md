# DecoderRing
## Project worked on during Week 4 of my Thinkful Software Engineering Course
This application can take different inputs from the user and encode them into secret strings using different types of cyphers!
The three cyphers available are Caesar, Polybius Square, and Substituion. 
All of the functions and tests programmed for this were done using JavaScript, Mocha, and Chai.
